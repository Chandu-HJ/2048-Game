# 🎮 2048 Game – React (GUI Version)

A fully functional implementation of the classic **2048 Game** built using **React**.  
This version includes a clean graphical UI and supports a configurable **n × n board** (default: 4×4).  
The game begins with two randomly placed tiles (2 or 4), and players combine tiles to reach **2048**.

## 🎯 Game Rules
- Use **Arrow Keys** to move tiles up, down, left, or right  
- Tiles with the same number **merge** to form a new tile  
- After every move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears  
- The goal is to create a **2048 tile**  
- Game ends when no more moves are possible
